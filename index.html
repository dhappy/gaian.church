    <h1>Gaianism</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Gaianism holds the existence of The Holy Spirit to be state of being shared among people and driving the purest forms of action.</p>
    <p>Gaianism rejects the existence of an omniscient and omnipotent being driving the experience.</p>
    <p>A virgin did not give birth. There is no one behind the curtain running the show.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>The aims of Gaianism are many and complex, but the most socially impactful aims are to develop a disintermediated market where buyers and sellers coordinate directly with a minimum of middle-men.</p>

    <h2>Worship</h2>
    <p>Singing together in public spacesâ€¦</p>
